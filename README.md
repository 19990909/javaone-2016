## Handling Eventual Consistency in JVM Microservices with Event Sourcing

When youâ€™re building JVM applications in a microservice architecture, managing state becomes a distributed systems problem. Instead of being able to manage state as transactions inside the boundaries of a single monolithic application, a microservice must be able to manage consistency by using transactions that are distributed across a network of many different applications and databases. This session explores the problems of data consistency and high availability in JVM-based microservices and how to use event sourcing to solve these problems.
